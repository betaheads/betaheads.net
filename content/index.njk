<p>
	Minecraft server running on 1.7.3 beta
</p>

<h3>About server</h3>
<p>
	Server designed for classic Minecraft gameplay. <br>
	So here's what we've been doing to achieve this:
</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>
	There is minimum number of plugins - no claims, no teleports.
	Plugins that we use are needed to make easier communication between players
	and protect players from griefing. Also we have plugins
	that helps maintain server stability and reduce lags.
	Our first rule regarding plugins - keep classic gameplay.
	So here will never be plugins that change vanilla Minecraft gameplay.
</p>

<h3>Whitelist</h3>
<p>
	Whitelisting is enabled on the server.
	To connect the server you need to fill out the form
	and go through verification process.
	This is necessary to avoid cheating and griefing.

	After filling out, within some time your application will be processed
	and you will be added to the serverâ€™s white list.
	<br>Our form: <a href="https://forms.gle/UzLmvb49xCwuWkXh7">link to form</a>.
</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
	There is a small number of simple rules.
	You can check it there: <b><a href="/blog/info/rules">rules page.</a></b><br>
	Please read before joining the server.
</p>

<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p>
	Also we have  <a href="https://betaheads.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki.</a>
	Check it out and feel free to contribute!
</p>

<h3>Map</h3>
<p>
	We have dynmap plugin installed.
	So you can view world map in live! <br>
	Check it out here: <a href="/map/">map.</a>
