Hey, everyone! Today is the server’s 1st anniversary!
It’s been an amazing journey, and it’s still going!

This past year, the server has grown a lot, both in the game and technically. And all of this is thanks to you!

## Betaheads achievements of this year

This year has been full of fun and exciting things. Here are some of the achievements I was able to collect:

- The world size is 2 GB.
- The nether size is only about 50 MB.
- The number of Discord members is 400+.
- Now we have our own wiki with 22 content pages, 60 files, and 375 edits.
- Now we have our own stats plugin. Since its launch, the total summed playtime is 161 hours.

## What’s next?

Main plans for the server this year are:

- Bringing more players.
- Continuing to work on the stats plugin.
- Some technical improvements.

This year, many more adventures await us! Keep playing!

Big thanks to everyone! ❤️🔥
