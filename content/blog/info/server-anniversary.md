Hey, everyone! Today is the server’s 1st anniversary!
It’s been an amazing journey, and it’s still going!

This past year, the server has grown a lot, both in the game and technically. And all of this is thanks to you!

## What’s next?

Main plans for the server this year are:

- Bringing more players.
- Continuing to work on the stats plugin.
- Some technical improvements.

This year, many more adventures await us! Keep playing!

Big thanks to everyone! ❤️🔥
