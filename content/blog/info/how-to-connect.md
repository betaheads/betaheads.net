Firstly - to connect the server you need client that can provide access to your license minecraft account. Because the server has online mode enabled.

There three most popular options:

- [Official minecraft launcher.](./#official-launcher)
- [Betacraft launcher.](./#betacraft-launcher)
- [Mineonline launcher.](./#mineonline-launcher)

**Disclaimer: these launchers don't always work, try another option if one of them doesn't work.**
