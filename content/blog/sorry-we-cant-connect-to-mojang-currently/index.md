If you’ve encountered the error message **"Sorry, we can’t connect to Mojang currently, please try again later"** while trying to connect to a minecraft server, you’re not alone. This issue usually happens when Mojang servers block your internet region. This can happen for various reasons, and it’s not your fault.

## How to Solve This Problem?

1. Firstly, restart your launcher (client) and try to connect to the server.
2. If the first step didn’t help, try logging out and logging back into the launcher.
3. If the previous two steps didn’t help, you need to install a VPN.
   You can use any VPN of your choice. Here’s a tested option you can download from Microsoft store:

4. Turn on the VPN and log into the launcher with your account. Then try to connect to the server.
5. If you still can’t connect to the server, try changing the region in your VPN.

If the error persists, it’s possible that your VPN is not working properly. Try download a different one.
